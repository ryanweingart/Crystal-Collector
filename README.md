## Overview

Welcome to Crystal Collector! This is a memorization game where the player must match the computer's random score to win the game.

## Directions

* The game has four colored crystals that each have a random value associated with it.
* There will be a random number displayed by the computer that the player must match
* As a crystal is clicked, the player's score will begin to increase; this will tell the user the value of that specific crystal.
* As the player clicks different crystals, the player must remember the specific value associated with the different crystals as they are added to their score to ensure they match the computer's random number
  * If the player's score matches the computer's random number, the player wins!
  * If the player's score goes above the computer's random number, the player loses.
* A new game will begin after each win or loss, with a new random number displayed by the computer and new random values attached to the crystals.

### Good luck!
